In Node.js (and JavaScript in general), var is used to declare a variable. It's not used to specify 
the type of the variable, because JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language. 

In addition to var, JavaScript also has let and const for declaring variables. 
let is similar to var, but it has block scope. const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.
