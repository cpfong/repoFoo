1. GET requests are meant for retrieval
By convention, GET requests should not have a body.
According to the HTTP/1.1 spec, servers can accept a body in a GET request, but most ignore it entirely.
The correct way to pass parameters with GET is via the query string:

2. Why -d with GET is problematic
-d in curl automatically changes the method to POST (unless you explicitly force -X GET).
Even if you force it with -X GET, many web servers, frameworks, and APIs will simply drop the body and only look at query parameters.
Some APIs might treat a GET body as an error (returning 400 Bad Request).

3. The safe alternative
If you want to send data with GET, use query parameters:
curl -G -d "name=john" -d "age=20" https://example.com

An HTTP request generally looks like this:
[Request line]      GET /path?query=value HTTP/1.1
[Headers]           Host: example.com
                    Content-Type: application/json
[Empty line]
[Body]              {"name": "John"}

Request line → method (GET, POST, etc.), path, and HTTP version.
Headers → metadata about the request (e.g., content type, authentication).
Body → the actual data you send to the server (optional).
