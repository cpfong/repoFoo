two ways in the shell to perform command substitution: 
 A by enclosing a shell command with back quotes 
 B with the $(...) construct.

$ echo There are $(who | wc -l) users logged in
$ echo "You have $(ls | wc -l) fi1es in your directory" #You have       13 fi1es in your directory
$ echo "You have$(ls | wc -l | tr -s ' ') fi1es in your directory" #You have 13 fi1es in your directory

$ lines=$(cat 3-lines.txt) #To store the contents of a file into a variable, you can use cat
$ echo "$lines"
